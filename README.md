# Vanilla Webhook

Created with [aws-cdk](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/work-with-cdk-typescript.html)'s init command (`cdk init sample-app --language typescript`)

The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app.

## Useful commands

* `npm run build`   compile typescript to js
* `npm run watch`   watch for changes and compile
* `npm run test`    perform the jest unit tests
* `cdk deploy`      deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
* `cdk diff`        compare deployed stack with current state
* `cdk synth`       emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
